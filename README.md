Problem:
Restaurants struggle to design menus that balance cost, dietary needs,
and customer preferences. This process is often inefficient and subjective.

Solution:
This project is an AI-powered menu optimization system that generates
restaurant menus based on real-world constraints such as audience,
budget, cuisine, and dietary focus.
